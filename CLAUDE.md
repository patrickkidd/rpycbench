# CLAUDE.md for rpycbench python package

## Rules:
- Create a venv with uv if it doesn't already exist, i.e. `uv venv`
- Run everything python in the uv env, i.e. `uv run ...`
- All features must have a quickstart in the README for both command line use
  with no code and python api use for application to existing python apps.
- All features must have tests added to the test suite.
